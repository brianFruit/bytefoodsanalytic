# Byte Foods Data Analytic

This is a analysis performed on transactions of Byte Food's Kiosk in the past year. Data exploration, analysis, and pipeline explanation are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook file (data_exploration.ipynb). 

## Prerequisites
The data analysis and pipeline were built with Python 3. A Python pip requirement.txt is included in this repo to reproduce the analytics as well as run the pipeline. Virtualenv or Anaconda are recommended to manage the environment.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the anomaly_detection Python script in command prompt or terminal. And then follow the prompts to find anomaly events in Kiosks and Products.

```
python anomaly_detection.py
```
